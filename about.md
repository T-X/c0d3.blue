title: About c0d3.blue
---

The name of this site sterms from two basic ideas:

* *Blue vs. Red:* <br>
  Use and write code to help and empower, not attack and weaken people
* *Information as a Fluid:*<br>
  Any code trying to treat it as solid will fail eventually

Code here means any laws imposed on a machine. (also see: [Codev2](http://codev2.cc/))
