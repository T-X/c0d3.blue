title: Another Blog with Jekyll
---

So, here it is, finally I could convince myself to actually set up a blog. :D

I am mainly going to blog about some technical things, discoveries and thoughts. But as various governments seem to have set sails for #Neuland for a "conquest of the internet", I will probably post a few things related to politics, too (and will probably shake my head a couple of years later once rereading the nonsense I have written :D).

Speaking of technical things: This blog is running on jekyll, hosted via github pages. I had started clicking through codecadamy to learn some Ruby, which jekyll is written in, first but with this neat blog post and it was actually easier than I had expected and did not need to write any code in Ruby yet :).
