title: Another Blog with Jekyll
---

So, here it is, finally I could convince myself to actually set up a blog. :D

I am mainly going to blog about some technical things, discoveries and thoughts. But as various governments seem to have set sails for [#Neuland](https://twitter.com/Schattenwolf_/status/347337958573084673) for a "conquest of the internet", I will probably post a few things related to politics, too (and will probably shake my head a couple of years later once rereading the nonsense I have written :D).

Speaking of technical things: This blog is running on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted via [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/). I had started clicking through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to learn some Ruby, which Jekyll is written in, first but with [this neat blog post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) it was actually easier than I had expected and did not need to write any code in Ruby yet :).
